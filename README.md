# Stock Brokerage System

In this project, we are taking live data of stocks and using it to make a brokerage system.
We are using Google Finance to get live data and feed it in Google Sheets. The sheet is passing data to the python file which in turn is writing the live data in a text file. The c++ file is using file handling to access and clean the data to store it in objects.
